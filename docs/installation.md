You'll need a Python version bigger or equal to 3.8.  
If you're new to programming this [page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) could help with learning resources.  

Once you've got Python setup you can install `property-utils` from your IDE or via pip: 
```
pip install property-utils
```

## Dependencies
`property-utils`'s only dependency is the [typing-extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) library.
